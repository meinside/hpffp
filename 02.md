# Exercises

## Comprehension Check

1. Given the following lines of code as they might appear in a source file, how would you change them to use them directly in the REPL?

```haskell
half x = x / 2
square x = x * x
```

let half x = x / 2
let square x = x * x

2. Write one function that can accept one argument and work for all the following expressions. Be sure to name the function.

```haskell
3.14 * (5 * 5)
3.14 * (10 * 10)
3.14 * (2 * 2)
3.14 * (4 * 4)
```

circleArea r = 3.14 * (r * r)

3. There is a value in Prelude called `pi`. Rewrite your function to user `pi` instead of 3.14.

circleArea r = pi * (r * r)

## Parentheses and Association

Below are some pairs of functions that are alike except for parenthesization. Read them carefully and decide if the parentheses change the results of the function. Check your work in GHCi.

1. a) 8 + 7 * 9
   b) (8 + 7) * 9

change.

2. a) perimeter x y = (x * 2) + (y * 2)
   b) perimeter x y = x * 2 + y * 2

don't change.

3. a) f x = x / 2 + 9
   b) f x = x / (2 + 9)

change.

## Heal the Sick

The following code samples are broken and won't compile. The first two are as you might enter into the REPL; the third is from a source file. Find the mistakes and fix them so that they will.

1. let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

```haskell
let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)
```

2. let double x = b * 2

```haskell
let double x = x * 2
```

3. x = y
    y = 10
   f = x + y

```haskell
x = y
y = 10
f = x + y
```

## A Head Code

Now for some exercises. First, determine in your head what the following expressions will return, then validate in the REPL:

1. let x = 5 in x

```haskell
5
```

2. let x = 5 in x * x

```haskell
25
```

3. let x = 5; y = 6 in x * y

```haskell
30
```

4. let x = 3; y = 1000 in x + 3

```haskell
6
```

Rewrite with `where` clauses:

1. let x = 3; y = 1000 in x * 3 + y

```haskell
f = x * 3 y
  where
    x = 3
	y = 1000
```

2. let y = 10; x = 10 * 5 + y in x * 5

```haskell
f = x * 5
  where
    y = 10
	x = 10 * 5 + y
```

3. let x = 7; y = negate x; z = y * 10 in z / x + y

```haskell
f = z / x + y
  where
    x = 7
	y = negate x
	z = y * 10
```

# Chapter Exercises

## Parenthesization

Attempt the above on the following expressions.

1. 2 + 2 * 3 - 1

= 2 + (2 * 3) - 1

2. (^) 10 $ 1 + 1

= (^) 10 (1 + 1)

3. 2 ^ 2 * 4 ^ 5 + 1

= ((2 ^ 2) * (4 ^ 5)) + 1

## Equivalent expressions
Which of the following pairs of expressions will return the same result when evaluated? Try to reason them out in your head by reading the code and then enter them into the REPL to check your work:

1. 1 + 1
   2

same

2. 10 ^ 2
   10 + 9 * 10

same

3. 400 - 37
   (-) 37 400

nope

4. 100 \`div\` 3
   100 / 3

nope

5. 2 * 5 + 18
   2 * (5 + 18)

nope

## More fun with functions

```haskell
z = 7
x = y ^ 2
waxOn = x * 5
y = z + 8
```

in REPL:

```haskell
z = 7
y = z + 8
x = y ^ 2
let waxOn = x * 5
```

1. Now you have a value called `waxOn` in your REPL. What do you think will happen if you enter:

```haskell
10 + waxOn
-- or
(+10) waxOn
-- or
(-) 15 waxOn
-- or
(-) waxOn 15
```

will show:

```haskell
1135
1135
-1110
1110
```

2. Earlier we looked at a function called `triple`. While your REPL has `waxOn` in session, re-enter the `triple` function at the prompt:

```haskell
let triple x = x * 3
```

3. Now, what will happen if we enter this at our GHCi prompt. Try to reason out what you think will happen first, considering what role `waxOn` is playing in this function call. Then enter it, see what does happen, and check your understanding:

```haskell
triple waxOn
```

will show:

```haskell
3375

4. Rewrite `waxOn` as an expression with a `where` clause in your source file. Load it into your REPL and make sure it still works as expected!
```

```haskell
waxOn = x * 5
  where
    z = 7
	y = z + 8
	x = y ^ 2
```

5. Now to the same source file where you have `waxOn`, add the `triple` function. Remember: You don't need `let` and the function name should be at the left margin (that is, not nested as one of the `waxOn` expressions). Make sure it works by loading it into your REPL and then entering `triple waxOn` again at the REPL prompt. You should have the same answer as you did above.


```haskell
waxOn = x * 5
  where
    z = 7
	y = z + 8
	x = y ^ 2

triple x = x * 3
```

6. Now, without changing what you've done so far in that file, add a new function called `waxOff` that looks like this:

```haskell
waxOff x = triple x
```

7. Load the source file into your REPL and enter `waxOff waxOn` at the prompt.
